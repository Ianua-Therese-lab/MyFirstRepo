My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year

I will maintain a 20–30-minute-daily-3 routine at least five days a week throughout next year.

I will publish 3–4 wellness posts weekly and collaborate with at least five industry professionals by December next year.

I will grow my network by attending 6–8 wellness or sustainability events and having one meaningful professional conversation each month.

I will follow a structured, ADHD-friendly study plan all year to prepare fully for the 2026 UI College of Medicine admission examination.

I will complete three professional courses and build a 10-piece evidence-based wellness writing portfolio by September next year.

I will lead or support a youth wellness or sustainability initiative that reaches 100–300 young people between June and October next year.

I will secure 3–5 consistent clients and earn $1000 monthly from wellness content writing by August next year.
